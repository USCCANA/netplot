# netplot

The goal of netplot is to provide a more flexible yet nicer graph plotting function with better defaults

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of netplot from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("netplot") -->
<!-- ``` -->

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("USCCANA/netplot")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(igraph)
library(netplot)
set.seed(1)
x <- sample_smallworld(1, 200, 5, 0.03)

plot(x) # ala igraph
nplot(x) # ala netplot

```
